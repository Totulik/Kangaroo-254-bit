This 254bit version is based on:

https://github.com/JeanLucPons/Kangaroo        125bit version

with ideas from:

https://github.com/ZenulAbidin/Kangaroo-256    (said to be buggy and not finished)


Compilation:

Download 125b version from JLP
replace files from here and compile


Notes:

Kangaroo254.exe is compiled only for CPU  (no GPU support), try -check switch

DP size is left untouched, 64bits contrary to 256 version with 256bit DP mask
hopefully it is long enough

Search interval is 254bits

In files here you can search for keyword "sky59", I commented almost everything
what has been changed  (no minor and clear changes)
Can even compare original files with these new files, tripple check is always welcome!
